# DRF to MkDocs

Unlock effortless API documentation for your Django REST Framework project. Automatically generate beautiful, interactive, and maintainable docs that accelerate developer onboarding and streamline your team's workflow.

---

## Why DRF to MkDocs?

`DRF to MkDocs` bridges the gap between your API's OpenAPI schema and user-friendly, maintainable documentation. It introspects your Django models and DRF views to automatically generate a polished, feature-rich documentation site that stays in sync with your codebase, empowering your team to build better APIs, faster.

-   **Effortless Documentation**: Automate the entire process of generating and updating your API docs. Say goodbye to manual work and outdated information.
-   **Accelerate Onboarding**: Provide new joiners with interactive, easy-to-navigate documentation. The "Try-it-out" feature and clear model relationships help them become productive from day one.
-   **Deeply Integrated with DRF**: Leverages `drf-spectacular` for accurate schema generation, ensuring your documentation is a true reflection of your API.
-   **Enhance Developer Experience**: Features like the interactive API console and in-depth model pages streamline development, testing, and debugging for the entire team.
-   **Beautiful & Professional**: Built on MkDocs with the Material theme for a clean, modern, and responsive UI that you'll be proud to share.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install drf-to-mkdoc
```

### 2. Configure Your Django Project

In your `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... your other apps
    'drf_to_mkdoc',
    'drf_spectacular',  # Required for schema generation
]

# Required for OpenAPI schema generation
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS': 'drf_to_mkdoc.utils.schema.AutoSchema',
}

SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS = {
    'TITLE': 'Your API',
    'DESCRIPTION': 'Your API description',
    'VERSION': '1.0.0',
}

# DRF to MkDocs specific settings
DRF_TO_MKDOC = {
    'DJANGO_APPS': [
        'users',
        'products',
        # ... list all apps you want to document
    ],
}
```

### 3. Create MkDocs Configuration

Create an `mkdocs.yml` file in your project root. You can start with the [default configuration](docs/mkdocs.yml) and customize it.

### 4. Build Your Documentation

```bash
python manage.py build_docs
```

For more detailed instructions, see the full [Installation and Setup Guide](docs/installation.md).

## Usage and Customization

### Building Your Documentation

To build the entire documentation site, run the following command. This will generate a static site in your `site/` directory.

```bash
python manage.py build_docs
```

For more granular control, `DRF to MkDocs` provides several commands, such as `build_endpoint_docs` and `build_model_docs`.

### Serving Docs with Django

You can serve your documentation directly from your Django application, protecting it with Django's authentication system. This is ideal for private or internal APIs.

For a complete guide, see [Serving Docs with Django](docs/serving_docs_with_django.md).

### Customizing the OpenAPI Schema

`DRF to MkDocs` allows you to override and extend the auto-generated OpenAPI schema by providing a custom JSON file. This gives you fine-grained control over the final documentation, enabling you to add examples, descriptions, or even custom endpoints.

For more details, refer to the [Customizing Endpoints](docs/customizing_endpoints.md) guide.

### Best Practices

For better project organization, we recommend creating a separate `docs_settings.py` for documentation-specific configurations and using the `--settings` flag:

```bash
python manage.py build_docs --settings=my_project.docs_settings
```

This keeps your production settings clean and your documentation configuration isolated.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of `DRF to MkDocs` by configuring the `DRF_TO_MKDOC` dictionary in your settings file.

| `DOCS_DIR`                       | The base directory where documentation will be generated.                      | `'docs'`                              |
| `ER_DIAGRAMS_DIR`                | The directory for ER diagrams, relative to `DOCS_DIR`.                         | `'er_diagrams'`                       |
| `FIELD_GENERATORS`               | Custom field value generators for creating better examples.                    | `{}`                                  |
| `ENABLE_AI_DOCS`                 | A flag to enable AI-powered documentation features.                            | `False`                               |
| `PATH_PARAM_SUBSTITUTE_FUNCTION` | A custom function for substituting path parameters in URLs.                    | `None`                                |
| `PATH_PARAM_SUBSTITUTE_MAPPING`  | A mapping for substituting common path parameters (e.g., `{'pk': 1}`).        | `{}`                                  |

## How It Works

`DRF to MkDocs` operates in a few stages:

1.  **Model Introspection**: It deeply analyzes your Django models, mapping out their fields, relationships (like ForeignKeys and ManyToManyFields), and metadata.
2.  **Schema Generation**: It uses `drf-spectacular` to generate a detailed OpenAPI schema for your API endpoints.
3.  **Template Rendering**: It renders Jinja2 templates for each endpoint, model, and ER diagram, creating Markdown files.
4.  **MkDocs Build**: Finally, it invokes MkDocs to build a static HTML site from the generated Markdown files.

This process ensures that your documentation is always an accurate and comprehensive reflection of your codebase.
